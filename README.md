**Contributors**: [Maya Rosen](https://github.com/mayalrosen), [Kendra Seaman](https://github.com/klsea), [Aarti Nair](https://github.com/aartinair11),[Megan McMahon](https://github.com/mcmahonmc), [Leehyun Yoon](https://github.com/ehyun1990)\
**Description of project**: Use [neuropythy](https://github.com/noahbenson/neuropythy) to visualize developmental changes in brain structure in participants from the [HCP Lifespan Pilot Study.](https://www.humanconnectome.org/lifespan-studies)\
**Goals**: 1) Access and download HCP Lifespan Pilot Data, 2) Run HCP preprocessing pipelines using a docker container on AWS, 3) Use neuropythy to retrieve and visualize age-related differences in structural properties like cortical thickness.\
**How to get involved**: Suggestions for other types of structural analysis (gyrification, TI/T2 differences) and functional analysis (resting state, tasks) are welcome. We look forward to analyzing the HCP-D and HCP-A datasets in the near future!
