Name: Neuropythy for Dev

Project url(s): http://github.com/mcmahonmc/neuropythy-for-dev

Contributors: Maya Rosen, Kendra Seaman, Aarti Nair, Megan McMahon, Leehyun Yoon

Description of project: Use [neuropythy](https://github.com/noahbenson/neuropythy) to visualize developmental changes in brain structure.

We used [HCP Lifespan Pilot Data](https://www.humanconnectome.org/lifespan-studies)

How to get involved: Help?

## Goals
1. Access and download HCP Lifespan Pilot Data
2. Run HCP preprocessing pipelines using a docker container on AWS
3. Use neuropythy to retrieve and visualize age-related differences in structural properties, like cortical thickness, gyrification, and T1/T2 differences
